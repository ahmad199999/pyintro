To all our readers in Sweden,
We will make this quick so you can get back to reading your article. We're a non-profit and this Sunday we humbly ask you to support Wikipedia. 98% of our readers have never donated before. If you already donated this year, we sincerely thank you. If not, now is your chance: By donating just 30 kr, you’ll help keep Wikipedia free and available to everyone. Most people donate for a simple reason—because Wikipedia is useful. If Wikipedia gives you 30 kr worth of knowledge, take a minute to donate. Show the volunteers who bring you free, neutral information that their work matters. Thank you.
